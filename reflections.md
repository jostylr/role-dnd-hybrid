This is a reflection piece on what I have learned so far in my role-playing journey. As of June 2018, I am moving away from finishing and using this system I partially created.

## Dungeons & Dragons

This is where my journey began about 30 years ago. The idea in D&D is to roll d20 to score a hit. Classes are the way that characters are created with some options in there as one goes along. The original D&D had very simple class options for nice simple dungeon crawl, tactical kind of games. 

But role-playing was always more of an interest to me in story-telling rather than number crunching. I want to create a new persona and experience it. I would use the constraints of D&D classes and be inspired to create a story that fit the options chosen. It is a time consuming process to create a in-depth character, but I was generally rewarded with very competent characters that I would enjoy playing with. My favorite was [Mord](jostylr.com/mordblog), but I enjoyed many others. 

I was never satisfied with D&D, however. I wanted custom options. For example, Mord was a cleric that loved wrestling. I wanted him to be very good at wrestling, but did not care about being a good fighter generally. This was not possible to do in D&D. I also did not like the length of combat, the hit points, or the flat distribution of the dice rolls (this latter fact took me until GURPS to realize). 

## Self-directed Role-Playing

Around 2010 or 2011 or so, I started dabbling with my own game design. I kept the d20 roll (I love that die), but tried to get away from classes and into skills. It was kind of a mess, but it functioned. 

What it taught me the most was that I wanted a narrative ability to flow the story using the direction of dice, but not having the numbers dictate something in absolute terms. The idea is less simulational and more narrative or cinematic. That is, characters might try something and the dice decides whether it goes well or poorly, but I as the GM decide to what extent (no accidental deaths, for example). 

Eventually, I hit upon a scheme of growing the size of the die rolled as part of the skill level. I thought that was cool and helped with the idea of somebody who is amazing should be able to crush somebody incompetent easily and without doubt. 

But it was too fiddly. 

I never did get a good magic vibe going. 

## GURPS

I am not sure how I came into GURPS, but I (re)discovered it during my RPG roving times. It had a fully fleshed out system with skills, advantages, disadvantages, etc. and without classes (though one could always create templates for such things). Even better, they came out with Dungeon Fantasy which was a whole set for doing fantasy RPG in a dungeon crawly way. It helped greatly to get through their large expansive, detailed set of genre options. 

I tried it out and it was okay, but it felt very much into the numbers. I again found myself wanting to narrate out of whatever the dice said. But it certainly is a great resource for whatever kind of skills, advantages, etc., that one wants to dream up. 

This is the system that broke my love affair with the d20. Still a cool die, but 3d6 is the way to go to make average results the average experience. 

## FUDGE

My new interest is in FUDGE. It rolls 4dF which are 6 sided dice, but each die has only three distinct values: -1, 0, +1. The dice rolled give a basic -4 to +4 mechanic with the bulk of results being -1, 0, and 1. The system urges using descriptive tags for levels: Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great, Superb. There is a whole mecahnic based on what all that means, but the idea is to get a descriptive direction from the dice based on the skill and challenge of an action. 

This system feels to me like GURPS without the fiddly number bits. I am hopeful that it might finally meet my desired goals in playing.
