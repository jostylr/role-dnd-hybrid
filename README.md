# role-dnd-hybrid

A homebrew version of dnd that focuses on skill acquisition.

The idea is that a certain amount of hours of training is available and this
leads to various levels in different skill sets. 

This matches reality better than a class/level system. But it gets complicated
in the setup as one has to track the time. It is even more difficult to
experiment with. 

So this is a system to that handles doing this.
