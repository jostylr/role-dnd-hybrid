# SDRP

These are the rules for Self-Directed Role-playing. The idea of this system is
to allow every character to customize their path as much as they want. 

## Skill Rules

Every action is based on a skill. The skill level gives a baseline die to roll along
with a bonus which comes from both the level as well as the attributes. 

The die can be an opposed roll, if the action is opposed by the skill of
another, or it can be to surpass a challenge level for something more fixed. 

A character can also opt to take half (rounded down) of the die roll as the
fixed outcome to the skill. This models a thoughtful, practiced approach and
is appropriate when confident of success. Surge points (below) are not
applicable if using take-half.

Skills are grown by dedicated training and use of the skills. Using the skills
in an adventure leads to a large gain in ability. Those gains are given by
points which translates into 1 hour of training time. One can apply at most
20% of any particular experience to a given skill, school, or category. 

Each skill is part of a school and each school is part of a category. Schools
take more points to advance in and categories even more. Each level in a
school or category, however, adds to all the skills underneath it. 

Attributes aid in the use of skills, as listed with the skills. 

Schools take three times the cost of a skill to gain a level, a category takes
three times the cost of a school, and an attribute costs twice the cost of a
category. 

Each level progression for a skill is based on a starting level of 40 and then
it goes up by multiplying by `3`, then `2.5`, `2`, `1.5` and then it adds `1500`
for `5 levels`. After that, we add a fixed `2000` per
level for 5 levels. Then `3000` for the next 5, etc.  

### Points

There are three kinds of points that a character manages: 

* LP. This is a measure of health. When it drops to 0, a character is
  unconscious. If it becomes negative, then the character is at risk of dying.
  For the next three rounds, the character rolls a `Resist Death` roll vs the
  current negative LP. If it succeeds, the character stabilizes. If not, then
  the character takes further damage relative to how much it fails. If the
  character survives three rounds of this, then the character stabilizes. Sure
  points may be used.
* SP. These are points that add dice to a given roll.
* MP. These are used in dealing with using magic. 

* LP grows such that 5 points are gained per level invested in it.
* SP grows such that 1 point per level invested in it.
* MP grows such that 3 points per level invested in it. 

SP and MP are regained from short rests. SP is gained back as `(CON +1)*20%`
while MP are regained back as `(INT)*10% + (WIS)*10% + 10%`. Short rests last
at least 20 minutes of resting, maybe easy walking, talking. 

LP are not regained automatically. Use Life Healing or other means. 

Long rest (hours of resting, probably sleeping) restores all SP and MP and
restores `20%*(CON+1)` of LP. 

## Combat

Combat begins with first checking to see if there is any surprise. Perception
would generally be the skill to use if one side is trying to ambush the other.
If surprised, the character takes no action the first round nor can it take
any reaction. 

Initiative is rolled, using the initiative skill. The highest initiative goes
first, then the second, etc. Ties are rerolled. 

Each round, every combatant gets a turn. On someone's turn, they can move or
do something light as well as either attack or cast a spell.

* Move. The base speed is 30ft. Size and other factors can modify this. One
  can move 10ft without a penalty, up to 20ft with a -1 penalty, and 30 ft
  with a -2 penalty to all rolls that turn. An adjacent opponent can react to
  motion with an attack or by also moving though the latter suffers both the
  motion penalty and reaction penalty until end of their turn. One can roll a
  Disengage roll vs the Counter skill of combatant to prevent reaction.
  Moderate heavy armor or other large weight bearings will increase the
  penalty by 1; very heavy loads increase it by 2. 
* Attack. Use an attack skill. An opponent can react either for defense or
  offense. 
* Cast a spell. Casting a spell that targets an individual allows reaction.
  Area effects allow defensive actions. 
* Other actions might include picking an object up, shouting something, etc.
  For each little action, treat it as a 5ft step if quick, shouting, drawing a
  weapon, and 10ft step if a little more involved, such as picking an object
  up. This impacts the move action. 
* One can double the movement by not taking any action.  
* Two weapon use leads to adding half the damage of the second-weapon to the first.
* Two-handed weapons lead to adding in an extra strength bonus. 
* Getting up from being prone takes the full move action and gives the -2
  penalty. While prone, attack and defense is done at -5, except for ranged
  which gets a +3 defense against same level. 


### Reaction

When attacked or a target of a spell, a combatant can react. Typically, this
is to defend. But one can opt to forgo defense and take an offensive reaction if in melee. 

For each defensive reaction, one takes a -1 on further (re)actions until the
end of one's next turn. 

Defensive actions include combat defense, magic defense, countering a
spell, and moving with a target.

Offensive actions include combat attack and magic attack (targeted only). An
offensive action can be rushed to take effect first which increases the
penalty to -2 and applies it in this round. To determine if it goes first, use
counter vs original attackers attack. The original attacker can use a defense
reaction (parry, shield, magic vs magic) without a reaction penalty. 

### Defense

* Parry. A successful defense allows one to add the difference to next attack
  against that opponent with same weapon. -3 defending against ranged attacks
* Dodge. Successful defense allows one to add the difference to wrestling move
  on next attack. -3 defending against melee attacks 
* Shield. Advantage is shield adds addition damage reduction.


### Bonus Action

Whether on the primary action or as a reaction, one can take a bonus action. 

The bonus action must be declared before the action takes place and should be
related somehow. It should be based on the action being successful. 

The primary and bonus both receive a -2 in the rolls and, if it is a reaction,
an additional -2 applies on further rolls to end of turn. If it is one's turn,
then the bonus action takes up the move action. Further bonus actions may be
possible, but it increases all the penalties by 2 per action; such a thing
might be a whirlwind attack. 

Examples:

* Successful attack followed by a trip
* Successful shield block followed by a shove
* Successful casting of fire wreath followed by weapon strike

It is also possible that the trigger might be not just a success, but a
particular outcome, such as the opponent one is fighting falling down. If one
wants to take advantage of that, the primary is not penalized, but the bonus
is at a -4. 


## Special skills

It is possible to have special skill bonuses. Use the same leveling, but just
take the bonus, ignoring the die (so every two levels one gets an increase).
This is for something like a special 

## Surge points

For any skill use with a die roll, one can add in a surge die. This die is one
lower than the skill die, i.e., if 1d8 is the level, then 1d6 is the surge
die. For each point used, one gets another roll at a lower level. When the 1d4
level is reached, each additional point adds another 1d4 (no limit).

Opposed rolls have the opponent being aware of a surge, but not how much. 

This applies to non-magic skills.

If SP reaches 0, then the character feels exhausted and is at a -3 to all
rolls until at least 1 SP is regained. 

## Magic

Magic is governed by 12 domains. Each domain has an opposed domain. Each
domain has a series of "spells", one per level. Each level is progressively
more difficult than the other levels to cast. 

* Fire vs Water
* Earth vs Air
* Light vs Physical
* Life vs Death
* Mental vs Space-time
* Force vs Magic

There are three different skills associated with each domain:

* Knowledge. When casting a spell, the first roll is a knowledge check. It
  must surpass the following challenge based on the spell level: 
  
        1<3,  2<6,  3<8,  4<11, 5<15, 
        6<18, 7<22, 8<25, 9<39, 10<40

    Failure. If the check fails, then the spell casting fails. To stop it from getting
    out of control, the caster must expend the number of magic points equal to
    the level of failure times the level of spell. If the caster does not have
    enough MP, then LP make up the difference. 

    Success. If successful, the excess points (if any) can be used to do a
    kind of a recast of a spell. One can modify the combined spell in
    different ways, but at its base it should be equivalent to multiple casts.
    The cost of MP is that of the level and the same for each recast. 
    extra skill die for the power roll, 1 MP per die roll excluding the first. 
* Power. This is used for the power of a spell. This is often an opposed roll
  vs defense and leads to damage results. If 
* Defense. This is used in defending against spells of the given domain. MP
  can be expended to increase number of die. One can detect vaguely how much
  power is in the incoming spell. 

To cast a counter spell using the opposition domain, use the knowledge in the
same fashion, cast at the level of the spell, except failure leads to those
points being added to the power level of the incoming spell. If successful in
knowledge roll, then do an opposed power to the raw power of incoming; the
difference is the remaining power of the incoming spell; if 0 or negative, the
spell does not apply. 

### Magic Items

To create a magical item, a spell needs to be cast on an item `10*level`
times. The average power level per casting is what the power level becomes.
Once primed, a charge can be added by casting the spell into it. 

To make it automatically rechargeable, an Amplify Magic spell must be cast
with a power level equivalent to `lvl*power`. That is, if the average power is
5, for example and it is level 3, then the amplify requires `15 pwr`. This
must be done for each charge to be renewed daily. This renewal only occurs in
area where magic flows freely. 

If an item is used more than its charges, it starts sucking the MP and then LP
from user. 

For cursed items, they apply their curse at the earliest opportunity each day.
When its charges are depleted, it stops for the day.  

This can lead to setting costs and times for the spell. Roughly 1 day per
casting and `lvl*total MP used*10` for base currency, or something like that.
This also factors in having suitable materials to hold the magic. 


### Self-Enhancements

It is also possible to try and enhance oneself through magical means (or to
view it as a racial trait). Roughly, convert the day above to 10 hours and add
in the cost per 10 hours. 

(Need to see if this works out).
