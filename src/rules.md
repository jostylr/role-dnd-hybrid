# SDRP

These are the rules for Self-Directed Role-playing. The idea of this system is
to allow every character to customize their path as much as they want. 

## Skill Rules

Every action is based on a skill. The skill level gives a baseline die to roll along
with a bonus which comes from both the level as well as the attributes. 

The die can be an opposed roll, if the action is opposed by the skill of
another, or it can be to surpass a challenge level for something more fixed. 

A character can also opt to take half (rounded down) of the die roll as the
fixed outcome to the skill. This models a thoughtful, practiced approach and
is appropriate when confident of success. Surge points (below) are not
applicable if using take-half.

Skills are grown by dedicated training and use of the skills. Using the skills
in an adventure leads to a large gain in ability. Those gains are given by
points which translates into 1 hour of training time. One can apply at most
10% of any experience to a given skill, school, or category. 

Each skill is part of a school and each school is part of a category. Schools
take more points to advance in and categories even more. Each level in a
school or category, however, adds to all the skills underneath it. 

## Combat

Combat begins with first checking to see if there is any surprise. Perception
would generally be the skill to use if one side is trying to ambush the other.
If surprised, the character takes no action the first round nor can it take
any reaction. 

Initiative is rolled, using the initiative skill. The highest initiative goes
first, then the second, etc. Ties are rerolled. 

Each round, every combatant gets a turn. On someone's turn, they can move or
do something light as well as either attack or cast a spell.

* Move. The base speed is 30ft. Size and other factors can modify this. One
  can move 10ft without a penalty, up to 20ft with a -1 penalty, and 30 ft
  with a -2 penalty to all rolls that turn. An adjacent opponent can react to
  motion with an attack or by also moving though the latter suffers both the
  motion penalty and reaction penalty until end of their turn. One can roll a
  Disengage roll vs the Counter skill of combatant to prevent reaction.
  Moderate heavy armor or other large weight bearings will increase the
  penalty by 1; very heavy loads increase it by 2. 
* Attack. Use an attack skill. An opponent can react either for defense or
  offense. 
* Cast a spell. Casting a spell that targets an individual allows reaction.
  Area effects allow defensive actions. 
* Other actions might include picking an object up, shouting something, etc.
  For each little action, treat it as a 5ft step if quick, shouting, drawing a
  weapon, and 10ft step if a little more involved, such as picking an object
  up. This takes up the move action. 
* One can double the movement by not taking any action.  

### Reaction

When attacked or a target of a spell, a combatant can react. Typically, this
is to defend. But one can opt to forgo defense and take an offensive reaction. 

For each defensive reaction, one takes a -1  on further (re)actions until the
end of one's next turn. 

Defensive actions include combat defense, magic defense, and countering a
spell, and moving with a target.

Offensive actions include combat attack and magic attack (targeted only). An
offensive action can be rushed to take effect first which increases the
penalty to -2 and applies it in this round. To determine if it goes first, use
counter vs original attackers attack.
