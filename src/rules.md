# Self-Directed Role-Playing

These are the rules for Self-Directed Role-Playing (SDRP). The idea of this system is
to allow every character to customize their path as much as they want. 

This is, in some sense, a generalization of the Dungeons & Dragons. The SDRP
framework is not a system itself, but a way to view and modify materials from
another system. The example system to modify is D&D which has a lot of
wonderful details and well thought out balances.

Here are a few of the main conceptual changes: 

* No classes. A plethora of skills exist instead. Advancement in skills
  increase the size of the die roll as well as bonuses. One must earn the
  right to roll a d20! Experience points are allocated to skills as the player
  wishes. Classes can be emulated by allocating appropriate percentage of
  skills to the classes. Computerized tracking of skills is pretty much
  needed. 
* No spellbooks or choosing of spells ahead of time. Magic is divided into 12
  domains and players can learn a domain or many domains. Magic points are
  used to determine how much can be cast and calibrates the power of the spell
  levels. Magic defense skills exist and this is how to reduce the impact of
  the spells. 
* Attributes and features are also gained with the same experience point
  system as skills.
* There are surge points that a character has that allows for an extra die
  roll, with each extra die being one of a lower level than the previous. 
* To hit rolls are opposed with defensive rolls, mostly. This reduces the
  impact of a hit. If a hit does occur than a base damage amount is multiplied
  by a certain factor depending on the to hit (increments of 4). Thus, damage
  is controlled, but correlated to how well one hits.
* Initiative. Any initiative system could be used, but the suggestions here
  follow the ideas of [Advanced Fast
  Initiative](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/221253/Advanced-Fast-Initiative).
  Each action a character takes is given a certain weight and is it added to a
  running total. Some randomness is sprinkled in. Failed actions can be
  somewhat compensated by reducing the action factor. A computerized system is
  used to give whose turn is next. 



## Skill Rules

Every action is based on a skill. The skill level gives a baseline die to roll along
with a bonus which comes from both the level as well as the attributes. 

The first level starts  at `1d4` and advancement alternates with a bonus
versus extra die level until `1d20+8` is reached. At that point it just
becomes bonuses until the `1d20+21` level:

    1d04+00, 1d04+01, 1d06+01, 1d06+02, 1d08+02, 
    1d08+03, 1d10+03, 1d10+04, 1d12+04, 1d12+05, 
    d6d8+05, d6d8+06,d10d6+06,d10d6+07,d12d6+07,
    d12d6+08,1d20+08, 1d20+09,1d20+10,1d20+11,
    1d20+12,1d20+13,1d20+14,1d20+15,1d20+16,
    1d20+17,1d20+18,1d20+19,1d20+20,1d20+21


The die roll is either an opposed roll, if the action is opposed by the skill
of another, or it can be used to surpass a challenge level for something more
fixed. One needs to roll higher than the opposition to succeed.  

A character can also opt to take half (rounded down) of the die roll as the
fixed outcome to the skill. This models a thoughtful, practiced approach and
is appropriate when confident of success. Surge points (below) are not
applicable if using take-half.

Each skill is part of a school. Schools
take more points to advance in (3 times as much). Each level in a school
reduces the cost of the skills in it by 5% per level. 

Attributes aid in the use of skills, as listed with the schools. Add their
bonus to the skill rolls. Attributes cost 18 times as much as 1 skill.  

Skills are grown by dedicated training and use of the skills. Using the skills
in an adventure leads to a large gain in ability. Those gains are given by
points which translates into 1 hour of training time. One can apply at most
10% of any particular experience to a given skill, school, or attribute. 

The base cost is that of the skill levels and is as follows: 

    Level | Base Factor | Skill | School | Attribute
      01  |    ---      |    30 |    90  |   540
      02  |    3.0      |    90 |   270  |  1620
      03  |    3.0      |   270 |   810  |  4860
      04  |    2.5      |   675 |  2025  | 12150
      05  |    2.0      |  1350 |  4050  | 24300
      06  |    1.7      |  2295 |  6885  | 41310
      07  |    1.5      |  3443 | 10329  | 
      08  |    1.5      |  5165 | 15495  | 
      09  |    1.3      |  6715 | 20145  | 
      10  |    1.3      |  8730 | 26190  | 
      11  |    1.2      | 10476 |        | 
      12  |    1.2      | 12571 |        |
      13  |    1.1      | 13828 |        | 

Above level 13, keep multiplying by 1.1 to the previous skill level. The
Attributes and School levels are capped at the levels given.  A computerized
system should be used for all this and can handle those higher levels. 

No combination of bonuses can reduce a cost beyond 90%. 

### Example

Let's say a character wants to have a Swim level of 1d10+04 and a strength
bonus of +2, giving a total roll of 1d10+6. To get the Strength, one spends
1620 points on it, ignoring possible racial bonuses.

One way to achieve the Swim Skill is to spend 1620 points on Strength and 5165
on Swim to get to Level 8. Another way is to spend 270 on the Outdoor School
leading to a 10% reduction in cost of the Swim, leading to 4648.5 for the Swim
cost in addition to the 270 for the school. 

If the character took one level of the Physical category, at a 270 point cost,
then the cost of the swim skill would be reduced by 5% to `945-47.25 =
897.75`. The percentages end up being quite useful as the skills progress
further up the chain. For example, a Level 9 progression occurs at about 300
points less. 

A Strength attribute of `+2` would take
`(900*18/12) = 1350` points while a +3 would require `2700*18/12 = 4050`.  

### Advantage and Disadvantage

In D&D 5Ed, there is a notion of Advantage or Disadvantage. This can apply
here as well as we roll the die. So those rules can stay in force. 

### Combining Skills

There are two ways to combine skills: 

* Two or more people wish to combine their skills together. Such a combination
  might not make sense, but if it does, the one with the highest die roll is
  the die that gets rolled. The bonuses of all involved get added together.
* Two or more skills might be combined together, such as in mounted combat. Roll
  the skills in succession, deciding on the challenge features of each. Use
  the increments of 4 to determine a bonus (or negative) to apply to the next
  roll. A special skill that handles the combination specifically can be
  studied and will apply to the skill that gets rolled first. 

### Special Uses

See skills.txt for a list of the skills, categorized by attribute and school. 

Some special uses are as follows: 

* Nature includes not only stuff about knowing plants, etc, but also the daytime cycles,
  etc, with a challenge of 5 for Nature roll to know the time, 10 for Nature
  roll to know north. 
* Perception. This deals generally with tingling of senses, but also
  spotting stuff and reading lips, both of which are suitable special
  sub-skills. 
* Instruments should generally have a sub-skill of specific instruments. 

Languages have the following interpretation: 
* 5 is for tourist level communication
* 10 is for 5 year old communication, great understanding of normal, everyday
  ideas, but somewhat difficult to understand and almost no ability to express
  higher abstract ideas.
* 15 Everyday communication standards, accent detectable if not native. 
* 20 Can mask non-native accent, can converse in quite abstract talk.
* 25 Different dialects usable. 


## Stat Points

There are three kinds of stat points that a character manages: 

* LP. This is a measure of health. When it drops to 0, a character is
  unconscious. If it becomes negative, then the character is at risk of dying.
  To not die, one has to succeed on a defense against death magic roll where
  one has to overcome the damage level below 0. If successful, the LP is set
  to 0. It is also possible for one to have a feature that automatically does
  healing to restore LP when hit at 0; this requires MP and magical healing
  knowledge. 
* SP. These are points that add dice to a given roll. In particular, for each
  1 SP expended, one rolls a die lower than the other dice rolled by the
  character. For example, if a 1d10 is the skill die, then spending 2 SP
  allows one to roll a 1d8 and a 1d6. These can be thought of as adrenaline
  spikes of proficiency, which can be quite a boost but can be hard to manage.
* MP. Magic points represent the cost and complexity of a magic spell. They
  are used when a spell is cast, countered, or defended against. Each defense
  is 1 MP. The rest is dependent on the spell. 

* LP grows such that 8 points are gained per equivalent skill level invested in it.
* SP grows such that 1 point per skill level invested in it.
* MP grows such that 5 points per skill level invested in it. 

For example, if 270 points are invested in MP, then that would be equivalent
to 9 MP. They are grown incrementally so another (675-270 = 475)/3 = 158
experience points yields 10MP.    

SP and MP are regained from short rests. 1 SP and 5 MP are regained per four minutes
of rest. This consists of sitting and not doing much more than chit chat and
idle hobbies. 

LP are not regained automatically. Use Life Healing or other means. 

Long rest (hours of resting, probably sleeping) restores all SP and MP. One
can restore 20% LP naturally, though healing magic is the way to go if at all
possible. 

## Attributes

The attributes are mainly useful for augmenting skill rolls. But some of them
have special uses. 

* Strength adds damage to melee weapon damage. This is factored in before the
  multiplier. 
* Constitution subtracts damage from each hit taken though not below 1 point of
  damage. It also reduces the cost of LP and SP by 3% per attribute point.
  This applies retroactively.
* Intelligence and Wisdom each reduce the cost of MP by 2% per attribute
  point. 

Charisma and Dexterity are very helpful in many skills, with Dexterity being
used for hitting and defense while Charisma is used for social interactions. 


## Combat

Combat begins with first checking to see if there is any surprise. Perception
would generally be the skill to use if one side is trying to ambush the other.
If surprised, the character gets a +6 to their initiative (most likely not
acting until all others acted). 

We use an initiative tracker. The very first action is based on the action:

* Ranged, prepared. +1
* Buff spell(s). +2
* Ranged, unprepared. +3
* Melee, charge, prepared. +4
* Melee, charge, unprepared +5
* Attack spells. +5
* Move. +3

After the first round, each of those major actions are a default of +5 to
initiative after action taken. It is reduced to +4 if a failure happens. 

Different action suggestions: 

* Move. There is a combat-move skill. Roll this and this is the number of hex
  steps to take. SP applies.  An adjacent opponent can react to motion with an
  attack with a +3 initiative modifier. Moderate or heavy armor or other large
  weight bearings will impact the modifier of the move roll.  Moves do a +1 to
  +3 on initiative, depending on how much of the move roll is used. One can
  charge and attack with a +7 initiative. 
* Attack. Use an attack skill. An opponent can react either for defense or
  offense. If no defense, then automatic hit. If defense, then it is attack vs
  defense. The difference is the hit amount. For every increment of 4, this
  becomes a damage multiplier. So 1-4 is 1, 5-8 is 2 times, ... The damage is
  computed based on the weapon. Melee adds in strength (as do javelins and
  longbows); ranged has no additional modifier. Armor + Con is subtracted from
  the damage after the multiplied is applied. Every successful hit does at
  least 1 point of damage. 
* Cast a spell. Casting a spell that targets an individual allows reaction.
  Area effects allow defensive actions. 
* Other actions might include picking an object up, shouting something, etc.
  For each little action, treat it as a modifier of +1 to +3.  
* Two weapon use is allowed and allows you to attack with both weapons if the
  second weapon is a light weapon. No Strength bonus on second weapon. The
  second attack is a bonus action with an additional +2 for initiative
  purposes. Take half is mandated for second weapon; use same defense roll. If
  hits, add weapon damage to primary damage and multiplier. Must hit with
  primary weapon. 
* Two-handed weapons lead to doubling the strength bonus. This adds an extra +2 to
  initiative for an attack action.
* Getting up from being prone adds +3 to initiative. While prone, attack and
  defense is done at -5, except for ranged which gets a +3 defense against
  same level. 
* There are stunned conditions which could do from a +1 to +5 depending on
  severity and prevent reactions. 
* Buff and attack. One can cast a spell on self as well as attack. This is a
  +7 total initiative. 
* In general, any bonus action from D&D rules will add an extra +2 to
  initiative. 

The Dexterity bonus shaves off .1 per bonus point for initiative. One can also
have a feature that does it in general or for specific kind of actions. 

### Reaction

When attacked or a target of a spell, a combatant can react. Typically, this
is to defend. But one can opt to forgo defense and take an offensive reaction
if in melee. 

This adds to the initiative modifier. Add +1 for defensive and +3 for
offensive.

Defensive actions include combat defense and magic defense.

Countering a spell is a +2 for initiative as being somewhere between defense
and offense and a bit more involved. 

Offensive actions include combat attack and magic attack (targeted only). To
determine who strikes first, both should roll their First Strike skills. 

An attacker who is attacked can defend with an additional +1 added to their
initiative.


### Defense

* Parry. A successful defense allows one to add the difference to next attack
  against that opponent with same weapon. Works only for melee. 
* Dodge. Always works if you can move. 
* Shield. Advantage is shield adds additional bonus. Disadvantage is that you
  need a shield and it takes up a hand. 


### Bonus Action

Whether on the primary action or as a reaction, one can take a minor bonus
action if a situation suggests it is reasonably related. 

It adds +2 to initiative in general. 

Examples:

* Successful attack followed by a trip
* Successful shield block followed by a shove
* Successful casting of fire wreath followed by weapon strike
* A successful trip knocking an opponent down followed by a weapon strike
  down. Could also be triggered by a companion doing the trip and then you do
  a quick strike (+3 if not following your own action). 

### Wrestling

Wrestling covers a number of moves, including tripping, shoving, as well as
grappling. The initial attack is wrestling versus a defense, but if a grapple
is successfully initiated, then the two opponents are effectively locked in a
wrestling and both to break out of it as well as do damage is wrestling vs.
wrestling. 


## Special skills

It is possible to have special skill bonuses. Uses half of a skill level for
the amount. 

For example, tripping could be a special wrestling skill. Having three levels
in tripping would require 135 skill points instead of the full 270. 


## Surge points

For any skill use, including magic casting, one can add in a surge die. This
die is one lower than the skill die, i.e., if 1d8 is the level, then 1d6 is
the surge die. For each point used, one gets another roll at a lower level.
When the 1d4 level is reached, each additional point adds another 1d4 (no
limit).

Opposed rolls have the defensive opponent being aware of an offensive surge, but 
the reverse is not true. The surging should be decided before rolling.

If SP reaches 0, then the character feels exhausted and is at a -3 to all
rolls until at least 1 SP is regained. 

## Magic

Magic is governed by 12 domains. Each domain has an opposed domain. The first
six in the list below are governed by Intelligence while the second set of six
are governed by Wisdom. 

* Fire vs Water 
* Earth vs Air 
* Light vs Physical 
* Life vs Death 
* Mental vs Space-time 
* Force vs Magic 

To cast a spell, it should have a certain amount of Magic Points associated
with it. 

The spell levels in D&D are translated as follows for magic points:

    Cantrip: 1,  Lvl 1: 3, Lvl 2: 5, Lvl 3: 8, Lvl 4: 11, Lvl 5: 15,
    Lvl 6: 19, Lvl 7: 24, Lvl 8: 30, Lvl 9: 36 

Modifying spells will raise or lower the MP cost. This should be done in
consultation with the GM. For example, a 3rd level Fireball does a 20ft radius
of damage. Reducing that to a 10ft radius might make it a level 2 spell,
particularly with a reduction in damage amounts. Increasing the radius to 30
ft but make it a level 4 spell. 

To cast a spell, one rolls the relevant magic domain skill. It is successfully
cast if it is above the MP level of the spell. So casting a 3rd level spell
requires expending 8 MP and rolling above an 8. 

### Learning Spells

To learn a spell takes `50*MP` hours. These are actual study hours, not
experience. 

If one has a spellbook or scrolls, one can memorize for the day those spells,
spending 3 minutes per MP to study them. This time can count for the studying
to ultimately memorize them. This adds an extra challenge when casting of 2
points. 

When learning spells that are similar, the cost can be reduced by half the
cost of the similar known spell. If the spells is a direct augmentation of
another spell (such as delayed fireball is of fireball), then the cost of the
easier spell can be deducted from the cost of the higher spell. 

If one tries to cast a spell that is unfamiliar and unprepared, then the 
complexity is tripled for the purposes of the spell check. 


### Failed Casting

If a spell is not cast successfully, the effects are dependent on the severity
of the failure: 

* If the deficit is within a third of the spell cost, then the deficit is the
  amount of MP consumed.
* If the deficit is more than a third of the spell cost, then the spell is
  fully cast (MP consumed), but it is done in a damaging way. A fireball will
  explode centered on the caster, for example. A terror spell will terrorize
  the caster. A buff spell will do the opposite buffing. 

### Multiplier

Some spell effects depend on how well it is cast. This is particularly true of
damage or healing spells. There is a base modifier and this is multiplied by
how well the spell is cast. This is determine as follows: 

* Subtract the MP cost from the roll. This is the most that one can use in the
  multiplier. This is the Complexity amount.
* If the spell is defended against, subtract the caster's roll from the
  defender's roll. The defense is the relevant domain defense. This is the
  Defended amount. If the Defended amount is 0 or negative, then the spell has
  no effect on that target. Defense costs 1 MP. 
* Choose the smaller of the Defended and Complexity. This is what we use to
  determine the multiplier. 
* For every increment of 4, increase the multiplier. Start with 1. So 1-4 will
  be the listed amount, 5-8 will be twice that, etc.
* Apply relevant attribute bonus to damage. 
* Apply the multiplier to the variable amount and that is the result. 

In deciding the factor in a given D&D spell, take it to be a fourth of the
total maximum amount, rounded down, minimum of 1.
For example, if a spell says to roll 9d6, then use 54/3 = 13.  
This is predicated on the fact that the caster should
expect to be better casting than the defender at defending, but not absurdly
so. Rounding down is in anticipation of an attribute bonus being applied.
The complexity helps keep it down, but not too far down
since a reasonable chance of success should make one expect to be in the 10ish
range. 

### Counter Spell

To counter a spell, the counter spell is of the opposing domain and costs the
same amount of MP and complexity. If successfully cast, compare the rolls of
the original caster and the one countering to determine if it gets canceled. The
highest succeeds. Surge points are allowed. If the original uses surge points
and succeeds in overcoming the countering, then that surge also applies to the
rest of the use of the spell.

A magic user can counter a spell at anytime. A third caster can also counter
the second caster's counter spell; this gets resolved first. 

### Concentration

Any spell requiring concentration follows the same rules as D&D, except that
there is a concentration skill that one can roll when damage or some other
environmental factor happens; the roll is against that amount plus the MP
level of the spell (more complex spells require more effort).

One can also use it if casting another concentration spell. Add the
complexities and roll to overcome that. This allows an advanced caster to
handle multiple low level concentration spells. When checking for
concentration from damage, etc., add in the complexities of all the spells
currently being run. 

### Rituals

Rituals in D&D seem to be there to avoid using spell slots. In this game, MP
is what is consumed. So, instead, rituals do not consume MP. This is a feature
(1000 points) to be able to cast spells as rituals. It takes an extra 3
minutes per MP of the spell. 

The idea is that the ritual slowness allows the MP to flow back. 

Rituals also allow for joint casting, allowing skill levels to be combined as
in general skill sharing. 

Rituals can also be used for spells that a character does not know. 

### Magic Defence as Saves

In D&D, saving throws are often used. Here, we do opposed rolls. These are
tied to skills and we need to translate attribute saving throw rolls into
skills. 

Much of the time, a magic defense is the solution. To resist poison, disease,
even death, do a defense against death roll.

For death, a character dies when their LP is negative of their maximum. Each
turn until the LP is 0 or higher, roll a defense against death vs. the current
negative. Add the amount (positive or negative) to the current LP. Reduce the
MP as 1 as usual for a defense. If 0 MP, then it is an automatic doubling of
the current LP loss. This continues until stabilized (healed up) or dead. 

Surge points can be applied as usual. 

### Opposing Domains

Casting a spell leaves an aura of a domain on a person for a short time. If
the next spell cast is of an opposing domain, then the roll is done at a -4. 

Defense against a domain is grounded in the opposing domain. For example, a
death defense roll leaves a life spell aura in place. This can make it extra
difficult to do Death magic given how used Death resistance defenses are. 

Mental could also be difficult given that it is another prominent resistance. 

To put it another way, a caster is particularly susceptible the magic it uses. 


### Magic Items

To create a magical item, the D&D rules seem sufficient. 

For Attunement involving classes, pick some feature or roll that could
suffice. For example, a robe of archmage could be activated by successfully
casting a 15MP spell from a magic domain and then the robe's effects apply to
that domain (+2 to rolls for that domain, advantage on defense against
opposing domain). Multiple domains could be done with casting those. As for the
armor bit, that applies if it is attuned to any domain. 

### Self-Enhancements

It is also possible to try and enhance oneself through magical means (or to
view it as a racial trait). One needs to see what skill progression is
reasonable and then pick the resulting level. 

A rough guideline is to use the complexity (converted to levels) of a
long-lasting modifying spell as the level, but one still needs to pick the
type. A category seems like a good progression to look at, but some features
might be more equivalent to a skill, school, or even an attribute.  


## Initial character

The GM needs to decide how many hour-equivalents 


### Races

Each race has various characteristics as given in the D&D books. We convert
those values into cost reductions for acquiring traits and characteristics. 

See races.txt for the breakdown.

A 1 is a 15% reduction, 2 is 30%, 3 is 45%, 4 is 60%, 5 is 75%, and 6 is 90%.
