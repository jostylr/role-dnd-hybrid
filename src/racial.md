# Racial Processing

This is where we process the racial information and convert the raw data into
something useful. 

The idea is that the various traits lower the cost of acquiring these;
characters of these races have a natural inclination towards those attributes,
but may or may not use them.

The idea is to assign percentage reductions for costs associated with the
traits. 

A 1 is a 15% reduction, 2 is 30%, 3 is 45%, 4 is 60%, 5 is 75%, and 6 is 90%.
