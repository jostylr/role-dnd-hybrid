### Some special uses

Hopefully, most of these are fairly obvious to use. But here are a few
comments that will no doubt grow over time. 

* Nature includes not only stuff about knowing plants, etc, but also the daytime cycles,
  etc, with a challenge of 5 for Nature roll to know the time, 10 for Nature
  roll to know north. 
* Perception. This deals generally with tingling of senses, but also
  spotting stuff and reading lips, both of which are suitable special
  sub-skills. 
* Instruments should generally have a sub-skill of specific instruments. 


Languages have the following interpretation: 
* 5 is for tourist level communication
* 10 is for 5 year old communication, great understanding of normal, everyday
  ideas, but somewhat difficult to understand and almost no ability to express
  higher abstract ideas.
* 15 Everyday communication standards, accent detectable if not native. 
* 20 Can mask non-native accent, can converse in quite abstract talk.
* 25 Different dialects usable.
