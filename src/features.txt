the formula ak+b tells us that the first skill level that works is a+b, the
next level is 2a+b, ... etc.  So we use the normal skill progression table,
but it takes ak+b skill levels to reach level k. Should probably use the same
for k and L in the formulas...  Namely, we solve for ak+b = skill level
(fractional)  and go with the integer part. So, for example, 0.25k would mean
that if the skill level was 0.75 then the level L would be 3 (0.25k = 0.75
solves to 3). 

A feature only applies if k>=1.  If the there is no k, then k = 1 when the
skill level is equal to that amount. 

(a,b,c) means k=1,2,3 at those levels. 

A line starting with a colon is an instruction to add to something else,
interpreting k before doing so. 

functions:  
die(level, ATT): returns what to roll and add.
att(class): returns an attribute for spellcasting relevant to class.
