# FUDGE, GURPS, D&D

I am trying to synthesize my delvings into FUDGE, GURPS, D&D, and this SDRP, into how I intend to run a campaign. 

FUDGE is a framework, GURPS is a library, D&D is a script library. I need to write the top-level program for it. 

## D&D 

1. The adventures of D&D, such as Out of the Abyss and Curse of Strahd, seem like something well thought out and detailed enough to be useful to run. 
2. D&D also has a ton of spells, magic items, monsters, crazy power ideas, etc.,  that can be a source of interest. 
3. I don't like the flat die distribution and the numbers are a little fiddly. I think balance can be hard to achieve. 

Conclusion: use adventure and ideas, jettison the system.

## GURPS

1. GURPS use a non-uniform distribution. This was nice. But the numbers are very fiddly and crunchy. Seems unnecessary. 
2. There are a ton of skills, advantages, disadvantages, etc.  
3. They have a lot of useful source books on various topics, such as running campaigns using Fantasy, Horror, differet Power systems, Magic systems, etc. 

Conclusion: Get a lot of inspiration from here and have it be a place for players to dip into. 

## FUDGE

1. The mechanics are great. Roll the Fudge Dice to get a bell-curve based distribution of -4 to +4, using named levels to get a feeling for the outcomes. 
2. A lot of great advice on being flexible and fun. 
3. Fudge points allow for altering bad rolls. Could be useful. 
4. Figuring out good experience progression can be difficult. 
5. Attributes should be developed based on skills. This seems reasonable. The attributes can then be used when skills are lacking. 
6. There is a whole thing on strength, scale and mass. Seemed reasonable. 
7. Really pushes for many different ways. This is a framework. 

Conclusion: Use the die mechanic, get inspired quite a bit about each interaction. 

## Path Forward

Here are my hopes for how to run this system. 

I will start out with Out of the Abyss and Curse of Strahd as the adventures. They both will start with minmally developed characters, just a seed of a few ideas for their future. This hopefully allows the players and myself to grow into the characters. 

### Skills

So skills are generally using skills from GURPS, FUDGE, or extractions from D&D. There are the following levels for outcomes of uses of stuff:  Dire, Terrible, Very Poor, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Very Good, Great, Fantastic, Fantastic+... 

One has a level amongst these, situational modifiers that might boost one's abilities, roll the dice and add/subtract, and then determine the level of the outcome. Some actions requires a certain level to be achieved to be successful, others will just have a result based on the level. 

Easy skills default to Mediocre, Moderate to poor, Hard Skills at very poor, Very hard Skills are at Terrible. To advance in a skill requires using Experience points (3 FUDGE points = 1 Experience Point). The first level of advancement is 1 EP and it doubles on each level. Training and/or dedicated practice is required to get to Mediocre level for the non-easy skills with more intensive training the harder they are. After that, experience is the way forward. Generally, a session should give 1-3 FUDGE points per scene. So one can get to Fair after one scene, to Good after two more, to Very Good after four more, ...

In addition to using fudge points for experience, one can also use them for redoing a dice roll by rolling two more times and choosing the preferred option; this can be their dice roll or someone else's that involves them. 

Fudge points can also be exchanged for healing: 3 points for removing hurt, 6 for removing very hurt, 9 for removing nearly incapicitated, and 12 for avoiding death. 

Another way to advance in a skill is to roll great success for use of the skill. The first level requires rolling a +2, the second +3, the third a +3 and using a fudge point to then do a second 4d roll of +1 or better, then +3/+2, +3/+3, +3/+3/+1, ...  Want the excitement of possible advancement to happen with it not happening too quickly. 

Skills should generally be at the level found in GURPS. Skills are generally put into a category, governed by an attribute or two. The better the skills in the category, the better the attribute; attributes are derived for the most part. Intially, they are all set at Mediocre. The highest an attribute can be is the top skill using the attribute. Each time a character advances in a skill, one can roll to see if the attribute is gained (no higher than the skill level that got advanced); need to roll +3 or better. 

For more narrow specializations, use the same progression levels, but 2 FUDGE points become 1EP in that usage. 

### Advantages and Disadvantages

These give a lot of flavor. Each advantage should be offset by disadvantages. GURPS can be used to help find balance on this. It should be a little customization, but not over the top, generally, and should be motivated. It is awesome if the advantage is coming from compensating for the disadvantage.

During the game, one can use the corresponding number of fudge points as points listed in GURPS to acquire an advantage or disadvantage. Again, this should all be done with some sense to it.   

### Magic

I want all of the characters to have seeds of a certain kind of magic. Magic is fundamentally a personal power driven experience (hoping to get more out of GURPS Power and Thaumotology). This hopefully allows for some free form ideas. But magic can also be academic based, using the spell lists in either D&D or GURPS Magic. Some of my work with SDRP could come in handy. The advantage of learned spells is that they get a +1 to their level when casting that spell. This is done by training.

Magic is regulated by negative impacts of failed magic. There can also be a gradual buildup of fatigue in the relative way someone uses it. Magic can be expressed in a variety of different forms:

1. Wizards. They study magic, learning the rituals. This is based on intellect and when spells go poorly, they start to get confused and rattled, unsure about their actions. They can create stuff out of magic. Disciplined fighters fit in with this. 
2. Druids. They channel stuff around them, encouraging growth and change such as vines growing or rats overruning. When magic goes poorly, they are physically injured. Their magic is one of constitution. Elemental stuff requires a presence of it; no fire, for example, leads to no fireballs. Rangers are the fighter version. Animal companions are typical.
3. Clerics. These cast spells based on emotions: compassion for healing, rage for smiting, fear for turning, courage for aid, happiness for sustenance, wonder for creation,... When casting goes poorly, their emotions go toward the dark side, turning on themselves or others.  Based on will. Holy fighters fit in here (paladins).
4. Monks. These are based on mindfulness, stillness. They can combine a physical act with their spell action. Failure leads to being lost in one's mind, reliving the attempt that failed. Wisdom is the attribute here. Enhances their actions, transports, etc. Rogues can fit into this tradition. 
5. Shamans. Lots of dancing in active magic, lots of delicate motions in more passive situations. Dexterity is the attribute here. Failure of magic leads to clumsiness. Barbarians, particularly working up into a frenzy, can channel magic into themselves, etc through this mechanism. 
6. Bards. Music is the delivery of their magic, one of charming and coaxing. Failure leads to loss of ability in the music: singing leads to throat issues and loss of voice, lute playing leads to damaged hands, ... Charisma is important here.
7. Sorcerers are summoners of monsters and channeling of other's energies; a sorcerer in service of a single enttity is a warlock. They perceive the holes and connections in the world around and exploit them. Perception is the key here, failure leads to senses being shut down, blindness, deafness.  

Necromancy could be fueled by most of these traditions. 

There are various energy types of magic as well, these being the twelve realms I have detailed elsewhere.

Pick a flavor of above and that is the governing attribute. Each of the realms are the skills to learn. In other words, one would learn to cast fire spells (that's the realm) and have a level in that, but use the different flavors above to determine what kind of magic.

The rough level of spell casting required starts with Fair for cantrips (D&D) and power 1 spells in GURPS. Each extra unit of power/level goes up a descriptive level in order to successfully cast it. 

In addition to outright failure, there should also be some exhaustion that sets in, based on the flavor and possibly the particulars of the spell scast. Roughly, if a spell roll leads to exactly the require level or to one level above success, then it adds a "scratch" equivalence to the attribute in question. 3 scratches, then 2 hurts (-1) at hurt stage to doing stuff with the attribute, then very hurt (-2), then nearly depleted (-3). After that, casting can't be done. One can regain by resting for five minutes per thing to recover. 

Failure to cast leads to: 1  level of failure results in 2 scratches and spell fizzles; 2 levels of fail is a hurt and spell backfires in a minor, but annoying fashion; 3 levels of failure is very hurt and spell has a significant backfire damage component to it; 4 levels of failure and the spell epically backfires, leading to dire issues and the spell caster is nearly depleted, caster must rest. 

ALTERNATE IDEA:  Similar to alternate idea as in combat, magic can be based on targets to achieve. Idea would be a cantrip has level 2 to achieve, and add 2 per level of the spell. So a level 1 takes a target of 4, a level 2 a target of 6, ... Magic is hard. There is a spread of 12 from the target of success to the level of failure. So for low level spells, the target would be negative, but for a level 7 which has target 16, a roll of 4 or less is failure. Bad stuff happens. Also, if one starts a spell and decides to stop, there is a roll to end it, perhaps?

### Combat

Rounds are variable. For minor combats (minions, random encounters), a round might be the whole combat. For the boss fights, much more detailed. Also, it breaks up when stuff happens that might alter the battle flow. 

Everything is simultaneous. Each player describes how they plan to handle the combat, GM plans on the monsters, roll dice and resolve. 

Each rolls an offense roll, defense roll, skill roll, and magic roll, as applicable. The rolls are done with the player being able to choose which rolls apply to which of them. 

Then the GM takes in all the levels into account and spins a story. Negative levels lead to something bad relevant to it (poor attack might lose to dropping a weapon or hitting a teammate). Then relative levels of stuff above Mediocre lead to actions. 

Damage is loosely based on FUDGE rules, but it depends on what a round actually represents. That is, if a round is the entried combat, then something that might just have been a scratch might turn into a hurt. This also depends on how well the offense went overall to determine how long it might have taken. 

ALTERNATIVE IDEA: A varying contest of skills, with the previous roll result influencing the starting point of the next roll. There is a target to achieve and one rolls until it is achieved. The player always wants positive numbers: a higher offensive result leads to damage to opponent while a negative defensive roll results in damage to self. So more positive is better. 

In detail, the character and opponent have skills. Character - opponent is the starting level. Then each roll adds or subtracts to it. The number to beat depends on the weapon and armor. Unarmored, unweaponed leads to needing to get above a 4. Each level of armor increase adds 1, each level of weapon decreases by 1. For D&D conversion, the AC increase is the point increase; for weapons, count 1d2's and subtract 1. So a dagger with 1d4 damage decreases the level by 1. Once the level is achieved, the difference above it is the levels of damage. There are just a few levels of damage, depending on creatures. For characters, six points is the basic though that can be changed by advantage/disadvantage. For each point of damage, all rolls suffer by that amount. Getting hurt should be rare and meaningful. For monsters, the overall scale may change (a dragon might have 24 points to hack through, for example, but it loses a penalty for every 4 points lost, i.e., the increment is obtianed by dividing the total by 6, round down). 

For each attacker, the defender lose 1 point of defense in the initial starting levels. It is dynamic in the sense that if an attacker leaves, then the 1 point of defense comes back. Also, one can try to attack multiple targets, each target added leads to a loss of 2 points for each starting point. It is harsher because attacking requires more concentration than reactive defense. 

Another facet to this is the possibility to convert defense and offense points between each other. In other words, one can trade a good offense for getting a better defensive posture, and vice versa. These could be advantages to acquire or even a disadvantage if one is forced to make the shift (rage from a barbarian for example would shift defense to offense, while a scared person might convert offense to defense). 

The advantage of this method is that it allows players to get a sense of how the combat is going and shift tactics if needed. It also means that if one is really close to breaking through while the opponent is about the break through their defenses, it becomes very tense without any actual damage having taken place. 

I have the perspective that damage should be rare and considered very bad. This also helps with the perpetual problem of characters being worn down by many enemies while the enemies remain fresh. A kind of fatigue probably should be put into the system, pretty mild, such as 1 fatigue for 6 "rounds" of combat (post combat), leading to a -1 in rolls, and adding up until a 5 minute per point rest happens. 

A particular difficulty is that of ranged and spell damage. This is less of a give and take. But maybe it is about working on the aim or power until it can overcome defenses, rolling until one is satisifed with attempting with taking the shot or throwing the power level. This is also something that can take into called shots. For example, taking careful aim to shoot an arrow through the eye. Use the GURPS modifiers for that, I think, should be fine. I guess the same could happen for melee, but that is harder. 

Still that leaves magic as it is harder to imagine a good defense against that. But it could be just an intrinsic part of how to cast a spell, with each round preparing the spell causing an energy drain and posing a tempting target to be taken out. 

This mechanism can also be used outside of combat for skills that are done over a period of time, such as picking a lock. In those cases, there would be a target to achieve, but there would also be a lower level at which something bad happens (break the lock or lockpick, fall from the climbing effort,...). So an easy lock might have a target of 3 and a breakage of -10, possibly breaking the lock instead of the pick. The starting for this is all fair is 0 level. A hard lock might have a target of 10 and a breaking of -5, breaking the lockpick instead of the lock.
