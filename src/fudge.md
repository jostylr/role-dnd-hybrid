# FUDGE, GURPS, D&D

I am trying to synthesize my delvings into FUDGE, GURPS, D&D, and this SDRP, into how I intend to run a campaign. 

FUDGE is a framework, GURPS is a library, D&D is a script library. I need to write the top-level program for it. 

## D&D 

1. The adventures of D&D, such as Out of the Abyss and Curse of Strahd, seem like something well thought out and detailed enough to be useful to run. 
2. D&D also has a ton of spells, magic items, monsters, crazy power ideas, etc.,  that can be a source of interest. 
3. I don't like the flat die distribution and the numbers are a little fiddly. I think balance can be hard to achieve. 

Conclusion: use adventure and ideas, jettison the system.

## GURPS

1. GURPS use a non-uniform distribution. This was nice. But the numbers are very fiddly and crunchy. Seems unnecessary. 
2. There are a ton of skills, advantages, disadvantages, etc.  
3. They have a lot of useful source books on various topics, such as running campaigns using Fantasy, Horror, differet Power systems, Magic systems, etc. 

Conclusion: Get a lot of inspiration from here and have it be a place for players to dip into. 

## FUDGE

1. The mechanics are great. Roll the Fudge Dice to get a bell-curve based distribution of -4 to +4, using named levels to get a feeling for the outcomes. 
2. A lot of great advice on being flexible and fun. 
3. Fudge points allow for altering bad rolls. Could be useful. 
4. Figuring out good experience progression can be difficult. 
5. Attributes should be developed based on skills. This seems reasonable. The attributes can then be used when skills are lacking. 
6. There is a whole thing on strength, scale and mass. Seemed reasonable. 
7. Really pushes for many different ways. This is a framework. 

Conclusion: Use the die mechanic, get inspired quite a bit about each interaction. 

## Path Forward

Here are my hopes for how to run this system. 

I will start out with Out of the Abyss and Curse of Strahd as the adventures. They both will start with minmally developed characters, just a seed of a few ideas for their future. This hopefully allows the players and myself to grow into the characters. 

I want all of the characters to have seeds of a certain kind of magic. Magic is fundamentally a personal power driven experience (hoping to get more out of GURPS Power and Thaumotology). This hopefully allows for some free form ideas. But magic can also be academic based, using the spell lists in either D&D or GURPS Magic. Some of my work with SDRP could come in handy. The advantage of learned spells is that they get a +1 to their levels.
