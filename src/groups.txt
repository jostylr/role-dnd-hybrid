This deals with trying to preload characters of various types with appropriate
skill levels. The idea here is that 10% of any experience gets applied to
Core. Classes get 30% bonus to experience, Archetypes get 50%. It gets spread
to quite a bit, but one gets a nice boost to compensate. 

Within each listing, 10% goes to attributes, 10% goes to points, 40% goes to
skills, and 40% goes to features. If one of those categories is not present,
its points get divided to the others in the same proportion. 30% comes off
(total) the top for any groups.

:# means to spread that number out to each category separated by commmas;
without it, spread out so that the sum is the number
\d%\d Name means that this is a feature that helps reduce the cost of
acquiring of what is named. (e.g.,  2%MP reduces the cost of acquiring MP by 2% per skill level). The second
number is the maximum.
@Name is something that takes in a list of names, possibly skills, subskills,
features, etc.,  and applies them. These are features that a class can choose
an option from. 
:* means to apply it to all the skills and the school listed
:, means include school and what follows
#Name is another group name
Spells: gives particular spells that get learned.
