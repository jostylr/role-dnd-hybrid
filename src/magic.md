# Magic

Magic is complicated. See the rules for what rolls happen. 

Given a successful casting and a positive power level for the spell, then we
use the power to power the effects of the spells. 

There are initial amounts set for the various parameters and then there is
power to the variable. For damage spells, left over power is what is used vs
spell defense in determining damage.
